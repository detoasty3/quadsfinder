# QuadsFinder: Finds Maximum Quads Layout

This is a computer program in C++ that finds q(k,d) through a brute-force algorithm and through a recursive sequence (that is still conjectured). This project was created in part due to the **2024 Polymath Jr REU**, under the mentorship of Dr. Timothy Goldberg and Dr. Lauren Rose.

To run (assuming g++ exists):

1. Type ``g++ moserdebrujin.cpp -o test`` or ``g++ brute_v1.cpp -o test`` into Terminal.
2. Type ``./test`` into Terminal.
