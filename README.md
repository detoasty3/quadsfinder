# QuadsFinder: Finds Maximum Quads Layout (2024 Polymath Jr REU)

This is a computer program in C++ that finds q(k,d) through a brute-force algorithm and through a recursive sequence (that is still conjectured).

To run (assuming g++ exists):

1. Type ``g++ moserdebrujin.cpp -o test`` or ``g++ brute_v1.cpp -o test`` into Terminal.
2. Type ``./test`` into Terminal.
